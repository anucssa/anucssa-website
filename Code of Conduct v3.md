#ANU CSSA Code of Conduct#
*Common Room*

Everyone in the Common Room is required to agree with the following code of conduct. CSSA Committee Members and Common Room Officers will enforce this code. We expect cooperation from everyone to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

**tl;dr: Be excellent with each other**

##Need Help?##
Talk to one of the committee members or common room officers. Their names and photos are on the poster on the left.

##The Quick Version##
The CSSA is dedicated to keeping the common room a harassment-free space for everyone, regardless of gender, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of people in this space in any form. Please respect the common room as a shared space for all our members. Members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the common room at the discretion of the CSSA Committee or Common Room Officers.

##The Less Quick Version##
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If people engage in harassing behaviour, committee members or common room officers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the common room.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the CSSA Committee or a Common Room Officer immediately. These people and ways to contact them can be identified from the poster to the left (“CSSA Committee and Common Room Officers”).

##A few other things##
Alcohol is not to be stored or consumed in the common room.
This is a shared space – keep the volume to a reasonable level, and use headphones if you are playing loud music, videos, or playing games. Loud can be taken as ‘above quiet conversation’.
Keep the common room clean – pick up rubbish (the bins are in the corridor), even if it is not yours.
If a discussion or argument escalates to a point where it is distressing other members, the parties responsible may be asked to leave.
